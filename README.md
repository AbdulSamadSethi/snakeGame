## This is a quick GoDot project i made based on the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRP-UBR-2A by Coding with Russ. 
### It was to learn the basic infrastructure of GoDot and how to use it.
#### Will probably edit this to make it a bit cooler but for now it's just the bare bones Snake Game
